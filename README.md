## **About the Project** 📚

This project builds upon my previous work but brings new improvements and ideas.  
I've chosen to implement **HTTPS communication** to reduce detection by AV/EDR systems and make the communication channel more secure.  

The final goal is to create a fully functional **C2 system** that can also serve as a **botnet**, capable of performing remote administration tasks and testing advanced techniques such as anti-sandboxing, persistence, and privilege escalation.

## **How It Works** 🛠️

1. **Deploy the Disposable Interface C2** 🌐  
   A temporary server can be set up quickly to hide the location of the main C2 infrastructure.

2. **Secure Communication** 🔒  
   All communications between the client and server use **HTTPS** to reduce detection.

3. **Remote Administration Features** 🐚  
   - Shell execution.  
   - File exfiltration.  
   - Process injection and process pivoting.

4. **Persistence Techniques** ♾️  
   - Registry key additions.  
   - DLL hijacking/sideloading.  
   - Startup program scanning.

5. **Advanced Operations** ⚙️  
   - DDoS capabilities.  
   - Credential stealing and keylogging.  
   - Local privilege escalation (LPE).

## **Usage** 🧑‍💻

> **This section will be updated once the initial prototype is ready.**

1. **Deploy the C2 server**.  
2. Configure the client to communicate with the C2 over **HTTPS**.  
3. Test and execute the desired operations.
